# Machine Learning with Python

A program that predicts music for its users based on a ML algorithm. The main purpose of the project is to understand how machine learning with python works.

## Question Statement

If there's an online music store. We ask user for their names and age and based on their profile we suggest them albums that they may buy. Here we're using machine learning to increase sales.

#### How it works?

- We build a model
- We feed model some existing data based on the existing users
- Model learns the patterns from the data
- When a new user signs in, we ask the model to make a prediction of what songs the user is most likely to buy
- Based on its responses we can provide suggestions to the users

## Solution

#### Steps

1. Import data
2. Clean the data
3. Split data into training/testing sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve
